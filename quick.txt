Take an array as input
quick sort(array, low index, high index)
   if low index is less than high index
      pivot index is output of the function partition
      quick sort(array, low index, pivot - 1 index)
      quick sort(array, pivot + 1  index, high index)
   return array

partition (array, low index, high index) 
        pivot becomes array(high);
        i becomes low-1
        j becomes low
        if j is less than high - 1
            if array(j) is less than or equal to pivot
                increment in i by 1
                swap array(i) by array(j)
            increment in j by 1
            go to step 13
        swap array(i + 1) by array(high)
        return i+1
