Take an array as input
Look at  array, i is the index of the array
     if key value <- array(i)
     j <- i - 1
     if j greater than and equal to 0 and array(i) is greater than key value
        array(j + 1) becomes array(j)
        j becomes j-1
        go to step 5
     array(j + 1) becomes key value
go to step 2
get sorted array
