Take an array as input
merge sort (array, left index, right index)
   if left index is less than right index
      median index = (left index + right index) /2
      right index becomes median index
      go to step 2
      left index becomes median index + 1
      go to step 2
      go to step 11

merge (array, left index, median index, right index)
size of left array (n1) will be (median - left +1)
size of right array (n2) will be (right - median)
left array becomes left to median index's elemnts of the array
right array becomes  median + 1 to right index's elemnts of the array
      
if i is less than n1 and j is less than n2
    if left array(i) is less than right array(j)
        array(k) becomes left(i)
        increment in i and k by 1
    else
        array(k) becomes right(j)
        increment in j and k by 1
    go to step 17
if i is less than n1
   array(k) becomes left array(i)
   increment in i and k by 1
   go to step 25

if j is less than n2
   array(k) becomes right array(j)
   increment in j and k by 1
   go to step 30
get sorted array
